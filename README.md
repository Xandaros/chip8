# CHIP-8 Emulator

This is a CHIP-8 emulator, written for the sole purpose of familiarising myself
with C++. As such, there should be no expectation of continued development
and/or support.

## Features

- All instructions are implemented
- Sound
- Keyboard input
- Timers

## Test suite

There is a suite of test ROMs created by Timendus and can be found
[here](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite).

There also exists a number of unit tests, which test some of the trickier
instructions and display logic. The unit tests alone are not sufficient, if you
make changes to the software please ensure the test suite still completes
successfully.
